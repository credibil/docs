# Introduction

Credibil provides a collection of libraries for building decentralized web applications; a new 
class of applications puts individuals (and their agents) at the centre.

## Building Blocks

The building of blocks of decentralized web applications are come from the domain of decentralized
or self-sovereign identity (SSI): Decentralized Identitiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and
decentralized web nodes (DWNs).

**Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** — tamper-resistant, self-owned identifiers similar to email 
addresses or usernames.

**Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** — digital credentials that provide cryptographically verifiable 
proof of things like name, age, drivers licence, etc..

**Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs)** — replicated data storage and message relay nodes deployed in
a mesh-like construct.

### User-Centric Applications

When combined, these building blocks enable the creation of user-centric decentralized web 
applications (DWAs). In contrast to traditional web applications, where user data is stored in 
centralized databases controlled by the application provider, DWAs store user data with individual
users in a way that is controlled by the user and not a central authority.

This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way applications are built and used, providing
users with greater privacy and control over their data while reducing the risk of data breaches and
misuse.

### Data Portability

One side-effect of this approach to applications is the ability to easily move data or reuse data 
across applications. For examples, a user could use the same digital identity across multiple 
applications without having to create new accounts or re-enter the same information.

## Implementation

The libraries are written in Rust and are designed for use in a variety of environments, including
WebAssembly, mobile, and server-side applications.
