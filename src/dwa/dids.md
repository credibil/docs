# Decentralized Identifiers

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are self-generated and self-owned identifiers used to uniquely 
identify entities without recourse to a central authority. DIDs are universally discoverable â€”
they are URIs that resolve to a DID Document containing information such as public key material
and service endpoints for the owning entity.

<div style="padding:1rem;text-align:center;">
    <img src="../images/did.svg" alt="decentralized identifier" style="width:80%;max-width:400px;"/>
</div>

In the context of DWAs, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are used to authenticate individuals
(or organisations) as well as provide and endpoints for messaging and data storage (DWN).
