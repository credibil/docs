# Decentralized Web Apps

Most digital activities between people, organizations, devices, and other entities require the
exchange of messages and data. Decentralized web apps (DWAs) put users at the centre of these
interactions by adopting a model that lets them store and manage access to their own data and
messages.

Conceptually, users bring their data storage and messaging services (in the form of a DWN) to the
application rather than them being provisioned on their behalf.

## Anatomy of a DWA

Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs) provide the data storage and message relay required for DWAs.
Given a user's Decentralized Identifier (DID), apps can access their public or private data, relay
messages between users, and transact with others without reliance on location or provider-specific 
infrastructure, interfaces, or routing mechanisms.
